## Problem Statement

Currently in New Zealand, much of the construction site safety is often monitored manually, which is time-consuming, prone to human error, and not always effective. This can lead to a higher risk of accidents and potential legal liabilities.

**Value Proposition:**
- Ensuring safety compliance can significantly reduce the number of accidents and injuries at construction sites, saving lives, reducing medical costs, and improving productivity.

The project investigates the idea of object detection of safety compliance items (PPE gear) at construction sites using labeled image data. The goal is to effectively identify whether workers are wearing proper safety (PPE) gear when working on construction sites.

## Industry/Domain

**Focus:**
- Construction industry, specifically site safety.

**Context:**
- The construction industry is known for its high-risk nature, presenting challenges in ensuring and maintaining the safety of workers.
- Various IoT and AI-based solutions are designed to enhance safety monitoring, though industry-wide adoption is still in progress.

**Application:**
- This projectâ€™s application extends beyond the construction industry and is also relevant to other sectors where safety compliance is critical, such as manufacturing, mining, and oil and gas.

## Stakeholders

**Key Stakeholders:**
- Construction company executives
- Regulatory bodies
- Site managers
- Safety officers

**Goal:**
- To reduce the risk of accidents, legal liabilities, and associated costs.

## Business and Data Questions

**Business Question:**
- How can we efficiently detect safety compliance at construction sites using object detection & tracking methods?

**Data Question:**
- What data features are required to develop a model that can accurately detect safety compliance on construction sites?

---

## Data Description

**Source:**  
- Kaggle dataset: ["Construction Site Safety Image Dataset"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snehilsanyal/construction-site-safety-image-dataset-roboflow/data)

**Details:**
- The dataset includes images annotated with labels for safety gear (PPE).
- Generated by collecting images from various construction sites and annotating them with labels and bounding boxes.
- Similar data can be continuously collected for ongoing model improvement.

## Data Science Process

**Data Analysis:**
- **Initial Checking of Data:**
  - Consistency in image sizes (640x640) and properties was confirmed.
  - Initial image quality check showed diversity, clarity, and consistency, with no major anomalies detected.
  - Label distribution revealed imbalances, particularly with the "Person" class being dominant.

---

## Modeling and Evaluation

**Model Choice:**
- YOLOv9 was chosen for its efficient object detection capabilities.

**Improvement Stages:**
- Basic YOLO model
- Fine-tuned YOLO model with normalization
- Fine-tuned YOLO model with oversampling and normalization

**Evaluation:**
- The fine-tuned YOLO model with normalization showed the best overall performance, balancing precision and recall across various classes.

---

## Implementation and Results

**Implementation Considerations:**
- Performance optimization for object tracking
- Model accuracy improvement through further data collection
- Deployment environment and maintenance requirements
- Cost considerations

**Outcomes:**
- The YOLO model successfully detected safety compliance on construction sites, with high precision in key safety classes.

---

## Business and Data Answers

**Data Answer:**
- The project successfully utilized labeled images showing construction workers with and without PPE, crucial in training the model for accurate safety compliance detection.

**Business Answer:**
- The customized model effectively detects safety compliance, indicating potential for reducing accidents and associated costs in the construction industry.

**Stakeholder Response:**
- The project addresses the need for safety compliance monitoring. A test implementation in real-life scenarios is recommended for further improvements.
